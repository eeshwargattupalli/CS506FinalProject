# CS506FinalProject
Instructions to run code:

1. In estimation.py, begin by entering the indicator for the stock you want to model
2. Enter a start_year and end_year under for which you want to train the model (both should be positive integers)
        -> Model will be training for all of start_year and end_year
3. In test_weeks, enter the number of weeks you want to predict for stock price (should be a positive integer)
4. enter "make install" to ensure all dependencies are installed 
        -> This only needs to be ran once!
5. enter "make run" in terminal

Notes:

-> Data processing and feature engineering occurs in model.py
-> Model creation occurs in predict.py
-> SDE solution approximation occurs in sde.py
